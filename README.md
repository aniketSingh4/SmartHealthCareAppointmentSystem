# SmartHealthCareAppointmentSystem
#Project Overview: 
The Smart HealthCare Appointment System is a web-based application designed to streamline and digitize the process of scheduling medical appointments between patients and doctors. Built using Spring Boot, this system provides an intuitive and secure interface for patients, doctors, and administrators to manage appointments, user accounts, and health records in a centralized platform.

The primary goal of the system is to eliminate manual appointment handling, reduce wait times, and improve healthcare accessibility and efficiency through smart scheduling.
